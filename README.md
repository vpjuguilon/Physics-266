# Physics 266: Modern Optics II

Prof. Caesar Saloma

## Course Description

Second course in optics in MS Physics degree program offered by the National Institute of Physics. Physics 265 together with 266 present a precise elucidation of the Kirchhoff theory of diffraction, the theory of image formation and aberrations as well as the theory of partial coherence of light. They provide students with a comprehensive and deep understanding of optics and the nature of light propagation and prepare them to successfully deal with advanced topics in optical phenomena including photonics and optical metrology.
